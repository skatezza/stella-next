we need a way to manage i18n for English and French throughout our app.

• we do have a Providers file for i18n (@/components/Providers, which is using I18nProviderClient from "@/locale/client";)
• we do have a file for the translations (@/locale/en.ts and @/locale/fr.ts)
• our app's homepage is built under @/app/[locale]/page.tsx
• we need to make the translations available for the homepage's components:
        - Hero from "@/components/hero";
        - Clients from "@/components/clients";
        - Features from "@/components/features";
        - Features02 from "@/components/features-02";
        - Features03 from "@/components/features-03";
        - TestimonialsCarousel from "@/components/testimonials-carousel";
        - Features04 from "@/components/features-04";
        - Pricing from "@/components/pricing";
        - Testimonials from "@/components/testimonials";
        - Cta from "@/components/cta";
